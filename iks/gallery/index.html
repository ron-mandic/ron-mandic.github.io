            <h2>Doaa's early life</h2>
            <p>
              Doaa was born in Daraa, Syria, which is located about two hours
              away from Damascus. She grew up with her five sisters and one
              brother. Her father worked as a barber. When she was six years
              old, protests against President Bashar al-Assad began, and when
              she was 16, the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011. As a result,
              her family faced significant challenges.

            <h2>Fleeing</h2>
            <p>
              After their father's barbershop was destroyed, the family made the
              decision to flee to Egypt in November 2012, seeking safety and
              stability. This move was prompted by the escalating violence and
              instability in their home country. Their journey to Egypt marked
              the beginning of their difficult and uncertain life as refugees.

            <h2>Doaa Al Zamel</h2>
            <p>
              Doaa was one of the 11 survivors out of 500 people in a shipwreck
              in the Mediterranean Sea in 2014. She was on an overcrowded boat
              along with many other refugees when the boat capsized, resulting
              in the drowning of numerous individuals. However, she managed to
              survive and rescued two children from drowning during the incident
              by keeping them afloat until they were rescued by a rescue ship.

            <h2>My Hope</h2>
            <p>
              The story of Doaa Al Zamel and her heroic rescue was documented in
              the book "Doaa: My Hope for a Better Future," written by Melissa
              Fleming. The book narrates her escape from Syria, her harrowing
              experience on the boat, and her journey to Europe. It sheds light
              on the challenging circumstances and dangers faced by many
              refugees attempting to find safety by crossing the Mediterranean
              Sea.

            <h2>The Ship</h2>
            <p>
              The "M/S Prinsesse Ragnhild" was a Norwegian ship in 2012 that
              played a vital role in rescuing refugees in distress at sea.

            <h2>Doaa and Bassem</h2>
            <p>
              Al Zamel got engaged to a man named Bassem. After the change in
              Egyptian leadership from Mohamed Morsi to Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,
              conditions worsened for refugees like Bassem and Al Zamel. In
              pursuit of a better quality of life, they made the decision to
              flee to Sweden. To begin their journey, Bassem used his life
              savings of US$2,500 to pay people smugglers who promised to
              transport them both by boat across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy.
              Unfortunately, Bassem lost his life during the shipwreck that
              caused the boat to capsize.

              They were discovered by the crew of the "M/S Prinsesse Ragnhild,"
              a Norwegian ship that was involved in refugee rescue operations.
              The crew of the rescue ship responded swiftly and saved Doaa Al
              Zamel and the two children from the water. They were brought on
              board the ship, provided with medical care, but sadly Malak died
              five hours after the rescue.
