              difficult life in Egypt, working for meager wages. My father
              constantly thought about his once-successful business in Syria

              I had a terrible fear of the water, unable to swim. It was August,

              Mediterranean. But I knew a friend who had made it to Northern
              Europe, and I thought, "Maybe we can make it too."

              One Saturday morning, the call came, and we were taken by bus to a
              beach where hundreds of people had gathered. We were then
              transferred onto small boats and onto an old fishing boat. Five
              hundred of us crowded onto this boat, 300 below deck, 200 on top.
